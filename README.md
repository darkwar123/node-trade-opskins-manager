This module is designed to be a completely self-contained manager for
[Opskins trade offers](https://trade.opskins.com/trade-offers).

Instead of being just a simple API wrapper, it's designed to take most of the work out of implementing trade offers in
your application.

**You absolutely need Node.js v6.0.0 or later or this won't work.**

Install it from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trade-opskins-manager) or check out the
[wiki](https://github.com/darkwar123/node-trade-opskins-manager/wiki) for documentation.

## Installing
